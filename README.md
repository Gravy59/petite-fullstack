# Petite Fullstack

Living proof that you don't need a large framework to build a fullstack web app (though it makes things _*so*_ much nicer).

Built with [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io)

## Features

- Pocketbase realtime backend
- Chat app
- User authentication
- CR~~U~~D support

## Roadmap

- Add edit support

- Add reactions

## Installation

Download a [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) binary and place it in the root of this repository. Run it with

```bash
  ./pocketbase serve
```

then create an admin account and a starting user.
